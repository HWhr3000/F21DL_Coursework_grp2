### Research Objectives
1. **Objective 1**: Predict the level of satisfaction a passenger will have based on their ratings for services like Seat comfort, Food and drink, In-flight Wifi, Baggage handling, etc.
2. **Objective 2**: Identify which service areas (e.g., Food and drink, In-flight entertainment, Cleanliness, etc.) correlate most with lower satisfaction scores, and provide actionable insights for improvement.
3. **Objective 3**: Determine whether factors like age, gender, or customer type (First-time vs Returning customers) result in different satisfaction levels. Cluster the data based on the data.
4. **Objective 4**: Determine the satisfaction outcome based on the image of a person taking the survey.

### Project Milestones
- **R1**: Project Direction and Questions (Week 1 & 2)
  - Define clear objectives and hypotheses (e.g., key factors influencing satisfaction).
  - Complete initial exploratory data analysis and problem identification.
  
- **R2**: Data Analysis and Preprocessing (Week 3 & 4)
  - Perform data cleaning, handle missing values and transform features.
  - Visualize relationships and identify important patterns.
  
- **R3**: Clustering (Week 4 & 5)
  - Use clustering algorithms to segment passengers based on similar characteristics and satisfaction levels.
  - Evaluate clustering results using silhouette scores.
  
- **R4**: Baseline Training and Evaluation (Week 6 & 7)
  - Train three machine learning models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes for classification.
  - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
- **R5**: Neural Networks (Week 8 & 9)
  - Implement Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), CNN, SGD for satisfaction prediction.
  - Fine-tune the model and compare its performance with the baseline models.

- **Additional Steps**:
  - Arrival Delay column contains null values.
  - Mean values is taken for filling the null values in this dataset

### Data Preparation Pipeline
- **Overview**:
  Describe the steps of your data preparation pipeline:
  1. **Step 1**: Load the dataset and inspect for missing values.
  2. **Step 2**: Populate null data by updating it with mean value and normalize the features.
  3. **Step 3**: Visualize data trends and perform feature engineering.
