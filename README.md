Group Information

	•	Group Name: Dubai_PG 2 Dubai_PG

Research Objectives

	•	Objective 1: Predict the level of satisfaction a passenger will have based on their ratings for services like Seat comfort, Food and drink, In-flight Wifi, Baggage handling, etc.
	•	Objective 2: Use the data to identify which service areas (e.g., Food and drink, In-flight entertainment, Cleanliness, etc.) correlate most with lower satisfaction scores, and provide actionable insights for improvement.
	 •	Objective 3: Determine whether factors like age, gender, or customer type (First-time vs Returning customers) result in different satisfaction levels.
	 •	Objective 4: Determine the satisfaction outcome based on the image of a person taking the survey

Project Milestones

	•	R1: Project Direction and Questions (Week 1 & 2)
		o	Define clear objectives and hypotheses (e.g., key factors influencing satisfaction).
		o	Complete initial exploratory data analysis and problem identification.
	•	R2: Data Analysis and Preprocessing (Week 3 & 4)
		o	Perform data cleaning, handling missing values, and transformation of features.
		o	Visualize relationships and identify important patterns.
	•	R3: Clustering (Week 4 & 5)
		o	Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment passengers based on similar characteristics and satisfaction levels.
		o	Evaluate clustering results using silhouette scores.
	•	R4: Baseline Training and Evaluation (Week 6 & 7)
		o	Train three machine learning models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes for classification.
		o	Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
	•	R5: Neural Networks (Week 8 & 9)
		o	Implement Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for satisfaction prediction.
		o	Fine-tune the model and compare its performance with the baseline models.
